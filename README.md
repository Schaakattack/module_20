## Project Description
For this assignment I created a joint savings account contract in solidity. I then compiled and deployed the contract in the Java script VM. From there I interacted with the smart contract and tested the functions, specifically the depoisit and withdrawl functions, to ensure it worked correctly. 

## Technologies
**Solidity 0.5.0**  
**Remix - Ethereum IDE**  

## Installation Guide
Add the code, compile the code, and deploy the contract using the Remix IDE. The Remix IDE is a browser based IDE - the link is below.  



## Usage

Contract Functions:
* setAccounts - Set the account addresses to deposit & withdraw funds with.
* deposit - Specify the amount of Ether, Gwei or Wei to be deposited to the contract.
* withdraw - Specify the amount of Wei to withdraw from the contract and which recipient address to withdraw to.
* contractBalance - View the current  balance in the contract.
* lastToWithdraw - View the address that last withdrew from the contract.
* lastWithdrawAmount - View the amount of the last withdraw.
